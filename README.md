ðŸŒ¦ WeatherApp

A Java Spring Boot web application that retrieves and displays weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API. It stores city and weather data in a MySQL database and presents users with a simple interface to view warm and rainy days.

To use the application, the user needs to create a database in MySQL named weather_app and 
configure the database password and API key, which are required for the application to function 
properly. The database password and API key need to be provided through environment 
variables in the configuration. The application can be accessed on localhost via browser on the 
path: http://localhost:8080/forecasts.
